# Resourcely â€“ Mental Health Companion Chatbot

**Resourcely** is a mental health companion chatbot developed as part of a project at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Aug 2024). It leverages natural language understanding and user-centered design to support studentsâ€”especially those with ADHDâ€”by providing wellness resources, mood tracking, and empathetic conversation support.
