# Resourcely â€“ Mental Health Companion Chatbot

**Resourcely** is a mental health companion chatbot developed as part of a project at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Aug 2024). It leverages natural language understanding and user-centered design to support studentsâ€”especially those with ADHDâ€”by providing wellness resources, mood tracking, and empathetic conversation support.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

Resourcely aims to help users manage their mental health through:

- Personalized daily wellness suggestions
- Real-time customer support and FAQ automation
- Mood tracking and self-care check-ins
- Empathy-driven chatbot interactions

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Rasa NLU** â€“ for intent classification and entity extraction
- **Dialogflow** â€“ for fallback NLU and conversation routing
- **Figma** â€“ for UI/UX prototyping
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ for training and testing

## ðŸŽ¨ Design

We used **Figma** to create high-fidelity prototypes based on user research with students experiencing ADHD. These prototypes guided the chatbotâ€™s UX and response tone.
